json-fom
========

Create a global handler for json file conversion to FOM (Frontend object model) based on user defined schema.

The basic idea of this project is give ease handle of json data on web client based applications. 

Obtaining a formatted row of data from a query to a FOM source can help building a view from the controller on a MVC environment. 
The use with frameworks like AngularJS can end up in the fast construction and manage of client side webapps.

The main drawback at the moment is the conversion of large sets of json data. But good web planification can solve this issue,
querying small sets of data from the data source.

As today it has been tested in conjunction with AngularJS and Bootstrap for 1M+ JSON files on firefox, chrome and IE8.
The classes are in old good javascript so the function on older browsers is possible even if not tested yet .
